# Dan Costa Portfolio
 This is my Unit 1 project. My first portolio.
 I'm trying to go above and beyond what's expected from me. I'm new to the industry, but I'm eager to learn. Using all I can to succeed.
 My goal is to be able to find a job with all the projects I learn with TechDegree. Therefore, I'll work hard to learn and use all I can from the corse.
